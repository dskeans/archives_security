### **2. C2PA Integration**
```bash
# Built and integrated official C2PA testing tools
git clone https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-attacks
cargo build --release
./target/release/c2pa-attacks --help
```

### **3. Automated Testing**
```swift
// Comprehensive Swift security test suite
func runSecurityTests() {
    // Test XSS protection
    // Test SQL injection protection  
    // Test privacy data removal
    // Validate sanitization results
}
```

### **4. Validation & Verification**
```bash
# Automated security test execution
./security_testing/run_security_tests.sh
# Result: 13/13 tests passed ✅
```
